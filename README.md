# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application where users can add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Type your tasks into the input field and click the "Submit" button to add them to the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Each task has a checkbox that, when checked, strikes through the text to indicate completion.
- **Delete Tasks**: Once a task is marked as complete, a "Delete" button appears, allowing you to remove the task.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Tasks are added, updated, and removed dynamically using JavaScript.

## Files

- **index.html**: The HTML structure of the application.
- **todo.css**: The styling for the To-Do list, including background images, borders, and layout adjustments.
- **todo.js**: The JavaScript that controls task management (adding tasks, handling checkboxes, and deleting tasks).

## How to Use

1. Type a task into the input field at the top of the page.
2. Click the "Submit" button to add the task to the list.
3. To mark a task as complete, check the checkbox next to it. This will strike through the task text.
4. A "Delete" button will appear for completed tasks. Click it to remove the task from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the To-Do list.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
